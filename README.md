# CIM-Website

This is my CIMW 140 (CSS & Reponsive Web Design Course)

* Implemented a cool navigation menu with icons for display.

* Added a couple of fonts from google's font API.

* Used multiple stylesheets to keep code more modular.

* Utilized Table Tags on two pages and Divison Container's for the layout of the website.

* Used JavaScript to build a Calculator and add Event Listeners to the Navigation menu.

**** This Website is my Spring 2021 Class Website to turn in weekly assignments. ****
